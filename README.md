This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 trends using Python. It utilizes the `StatewiseTestingDetails.csv` dataset to
calculate daily positive cases, handling data preprocessing tasks such as filling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting date formats. 
The data is aggregated at a national level to generate insights into COVID-19 cases over time.

The project includes:
- Data preprocessing: Missing value handling, duplicates removal, and date formatting.
- Aggregation of daily positive cases at the national level.
- Visualization of COVID-19 trends through a time-series plot using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Key technologies used in the project:
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Dataset**: `StatewiseTestingDetails.csv` (COVID-19 case details)

The project highlights data analysis techniques and visualizations to offer insights into the spread and impact of the virus globally.
